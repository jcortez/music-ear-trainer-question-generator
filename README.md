# music-ear-trainer-question-generator
A Ruby utility for generating all questions for my [music-ear-trainer](https://github.com/jcortez/music-ear-trainer) project. This utility generates MIDI files for all permutations of chord roots, chord qualities, and chord inversions that are possible in my music ear trainer.
